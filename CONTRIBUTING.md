## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/alexcorvi/apexo/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following rules:

-   Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

-   Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or "👍". Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.

-   Please **do not** write [enhancement]/[bug]/[Feature request] or similar stuff in the title of issues, as there are labels for that purpose that will be added by devs or collaborators.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

-   Try to reproduce the issue on [the demo site](https://demo.apexo.app).
-   Use the GitHub issue search, check if the issue has already been reported, if there are some missing details, add them in issue comments, without creating a new one;
-   Isolate the problem — ideally create a reproducible scenario and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What device(s) and OS experience the problem? Do other devices show the bug differently? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the app build/OS version/device in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1.  This is the first step
> 2.  This is the second step
> 3.  Further steps, etc.
>
> -   a link to the reduced test case (GIF, video, screenshot, etc)
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome, anyway you should consider that the application should run without any backend other than CouchDB, and I do _not_ plan to reconsider this decision.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that developers might not want to merge into the project. To avoid that you're free to contact me through email or The [issue tracker](https://github.com/alexcorvi/apexo/issues).
